/*
  For each task below, explain why the code is incorrect, what type of error that is, and how to fix it.
*/

//Task 1: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello World);
//Syntax error. Argument is missing a quotation mark at the end. To fix the error, add the quotation mark after Hello World to make it a string.

//Task 2: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print(Hello World);
//Syntax error. Argument is not surrounded by quotation marks, or variable is not declared. To fix the error, either surround Hello World in quotes to make it a string, or declare a variable called Hello World and set its value equal to something else before line 10.

//Task 3: Print out "Hello World"
System.Out.Print("Hello World");
//Syntax error. Java is case sensitive, and does not recognize the function due to the capitalized O and P in System.Out.Print. To fix the error, make the O and P lowercase so that it reads as System.out.print so the computer reads it.

//Task 4: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello World")
//Syntax error. Missing a semicolon at the end to end the function. Without to semicolon, the computer doesn't know where to stop reading, so to fix the error, just put a semicolon at the end of the line.

//Task 5: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello Wrold")
//Logical error. The task was to print out "Hello World", not "Hello Wrold". To fix it, just spell World correctly.

//Task 6: Print out "Hello World twice, one on top of the other"
System.out.print("Hello World");
System.out.print("Hello World");
//Logical error. To print on another line, ln must be added to the preceding print function, or else it will all print on one line. To fix the error, add ln after print in line 26.
