/*
  For each task below, explain why the code is incorrect, what type of error that is, and how to fix it.
*/

//Task 1: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello World);
//Argument is missing a quotation mark at the end. To fix the error, add the quotation mark after Hello World to make it a string.

//Task 2: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print(Hello World);
//Argument is not surrounded by quotation marks. To fix the error, either surround Hello World in quotes to make it a string, or declare a variable called Hello World bfore line 10.

//Task 3: Print out "Hello World"
System.Out.Print("Hello World");
//Java is case sensitive, and does not recognize the function due to the capitalized O and P in System.Out.Print. To fix the error, make the O and P lowercase so that it reads as System.out.print so the computer reads it.

//Task 4: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello World")
//Missing a semicolon at the end to end the function. Without to semicolon, the computer doesn't know where to stop reading, so to fix the error, just put a semicolon at the end of the line.

//Task 5: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello Wrold")
//The task was to print out "Hello World", not "Hellow Wrold". To fix it, just spell World correctly.

//Task 6: Print out "Hello World twice, one on top of the other"
System.out.print("Hello World");
System.out.print("Hello World");
//To print on another line, ln must be added to the preceding print function. To fix the error, add ln after print in line 26.
